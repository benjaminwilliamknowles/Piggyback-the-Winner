# Piggyback-the-Winner-model

This repository contains three modified Lotka-Volterra-type models used in the Piggyback-the-Winner paper (Knowles et al 2016).
Two of the models are published (Weitz and Dushoff 2008, Thingstad et al 2014), and one was created de novo for the paper (Piggyback-the-Winner model). All models were written up in MatLab by Jim Nulton as simple models to test viral and microbial counts data against.
Please address any concerns or questions to Ben Knowles at benjaminwilliamknowles@gmail.com.
